# Flutter BLoC Learning 🚀

This repository documents my **complete learning journey of Flutter BLoC (Business Logic Component)** — from fundamentals to real-world usage patterns.

The goal of this project is to **understand, practice, and master state management using BLoC** by building small, focused examples and gradually moving toward scalable app architecture.

- Core concepts of **BLoC architecture**
- Understanding **Events, States, and BLoC**
- Difference between **UI and Business Logic**
- Handling **state changes in a predictable way**
- Managing async operations (API calls, streams)
- Comparing **BLoC vs GetX (conceptually)**
- Clean and maintainable Flutter code structure
